This data science project is step by step process of predecting the fake news. We will first build a model train and test it. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,

Python Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning Matplotlib for data visualization Sklearn for model building.
