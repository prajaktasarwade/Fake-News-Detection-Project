- Project Objective

This machine learning model is built for predicting the news wheather it is real or fake using logisttic regresion 

- Task

 1. Data preprocessing
     – Handled NA values.
     – Used Stopword to remove the words which is not adding the value in sentecne.
     – Used Steamming to reduced the word into its root word.
    
2. Feature Extraction - Vectorizer to convert the text data into numerical data.
3. checked the accourcy of model using accuracy score.

- Library Used Python ,Numpy and Pandas,nltk,stopword,PorterStemmer,TfidfVectorizer, LogisticRegression, accuracy_score,Sklearn for model building.
